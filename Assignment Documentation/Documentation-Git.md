# Documentation - Git
Git Repository URL : https://github.com/Alek-beep/AssignmentPhase2
# Layout
My GitHub repository is arranged so that it is the equivalent to the source folder of the angular project. This was done to make it simpler to push changes to the repository from my local repository. The files for the back-end server are in the server folder and the src folder in the repository is the src folder of the front-end angular app. In the AssignmentPhase1/src/assets folder there are the .json files for the groups and users data structures. Also, all of the documentation for the assignment is located in the Assignment/Phase1/Assignment Documentation folder
# Version Control Approach
My approach towards version control was as follows; I would commit and push from my local repository after a milestone like a creating a set of functions that would be a good checkpoint to go back to in case anything went seriously wrong with the development.
